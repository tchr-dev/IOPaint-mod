# Project Documentation Rules (Non-Obvious Only)

- "models" in this project refer to AI models for image inpainting, not database
  models
- "plugins" are image processing tools (segmentation, upscaling, face
  restoration), not application plugins
- "controlnet" and "brushnet" are specific neural network architectures for
  guided image generation
- "powerpaint" is a specialized inpainting model with unique capabilities, not
  general power management
- "file manager" handles input/output image directories, not general file system
  operations
- "sam" refers to Segment Anything Model for mask generation, not AWS SAM
- "lcm" refers to Latent Consistency Models for fast image generation, not least
  common multiple
- "extender" refers to outpainting functionality, not general application
  extenders
- "cropper" refers to a specific UI tool for selecting image regions, not
  general image cropping
- Model names like "lama", "zits", "mat" are specific AI model identifiers, not
