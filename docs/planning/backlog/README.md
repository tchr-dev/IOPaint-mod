# Task Backlog

Planned tasks that have not yet been started. See [parent README](../README.md) for lifecycle information.

## Backlog Items

| Priority | Task | Created | Notes |
|----------|------|---------|-------|
| High | [UI Simplification: Quality Presets](ui-simplification-quality-presets.md) | 2026-01-18 | Improve quality preset system |

## Adding to Backlog

When adding a new task to the backlog:

1. Copy `planning/template.md` to this directory
2. Fill in Goal, Context, and Acceptance Criteria
3. Set priority and add relevant tags
4. Link to parent epic if part of larger initiative
5. Add to this README's backlog table

## Priority Guidelines

- **High**: Must do soon, unblocks other work, or has deadline
- **Medium**: Should do, improves the project
- **Low**: Nice to have, can be deferred
