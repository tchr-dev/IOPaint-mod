# Planning Dashboard

Task-level planning for individual features, improvements, and bug fixes.

## What is a Planning Task?

Planning tasks are actionable units of work that:
- Can be completed in days to 2 weeks
- Have clear acceptance criteria
- Are part of an epic or stand-alone
- Move through: backlog → active → complete
