Major refactor: Remove OpenAI compatibility and simplify architecture

This commit removes significant portions of the codebase related to:
- OpenAI compatibility layer and API integration
- Budget management and cost tracking features
- Custom storage implementation
- Job runner functionality
- Related tests and documentation

The changes streamline the codebase to focus on core inpainting functionality:
- Removed over 120 files related to non-core features
- Simplified API endpoints in iopaint/api.py
- Updated frontend to remove OpenAI-related components
- Cleaned up documentation and planning files
- Updated dependencies and build configurations

This refactoring makes the project more maintainable by:
1. Removing complex, unused features
2. Simplifying the architecture
3. Reducing codebase size by ~75%
4. Focusing on core inpainting capabilities
